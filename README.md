 Java: a system for customizing URLs & data managing

ABOUT:
-------
server-side system offers a platform for customizing URLs and data manage, using "Big Data" methods.

Docker Compose enables the system to efficiently handle communication with many databases simultaneously. By distributing the machine's tasks across various storage technologies, the system can leverage the strengths of each technology to meet its needs, at different stages of operation. Additionally, using Docker Hub simplifies the application's deployment and allows teams to work simultaneously by supporting multiple versions of the same project.
